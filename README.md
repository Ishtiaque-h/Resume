## Education

### University of Delaware, DE, USA
**MS in Computer and Information Sciences**  
_August 2024 – December 2025_  
- **Relevant Coursework:** Algorithm Design and Analysis, Introduction to Machine Learning, Mathematical Techniques in Data Science.  

**Academic Projects:**  
- **Lightweight Deep Learning Model for Monocular Depth Estimation**  
  Implemented several CNN models(MobileNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.) to predict depth maps from single indoor images using [NYU Depth V2](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/nyu_depth_v2) dataset.
  Iteratively refined hyperparameters, introducing optimizers and LR schedulers, to strike a balance between performance and accuracy in resource-constrained environments.
  MobileNetV2 was proved to be the lightweight solution for cost-effective depth estimation.  
- **Impact of Spatial and Temporal Resolution on Rainfall Prediction**  
  Analyzed the impact of spatial and temporal resolution on rainfall predictions for optimizing agriculture planning and irrigation schedules.
  The [CHIRPS v2.0] (https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/) daily precipitation dataset was used for 10-year intervals.  
  Implemented regression, ARIMA, Tree-based models (RF, GB, XGBoost, and advanced LSTM models to observe prediction accuracy.  

**Upcoming Coursework (Spring 2025):**  
- Introduction to Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Introduction to Cyber Security, Database Systems.
